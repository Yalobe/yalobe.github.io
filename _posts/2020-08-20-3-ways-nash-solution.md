In my senior year of college, I gave a seminar talk titled "3 Ways of Approaching the Nash Bargaining Solution."  Unfortunately, the talk was not recorded.  Here, I'll attempt to sketch the three proofs out again. I don't have all of my old notes, so this might be a bit rough around the edges!

## Introduction and First Proof

While walking down the street with a friend, you stumble upon \$100. Given that the original owner of this money is nowhere in sight, you two decide to split the cash. What split is optimal?

We can describe the options before us with the following curve:
